DRAW SOMETHING is a simple HTML5 canvas application that I created as a means to learn more about the canvas element as well as practice my javascript. 

This is NOT mobile friendly and only meant for desktop use. Please let me know if there are any errors and I would love to fix them.

TODO:
Add Touch Support so that it is mobile friendly
Ensure it works on all browsers
Add more functions such as:
*An Eraser
*Shape Tools (Start with 3 sides and allow the ability to add more sides so that we can go from triangle to square to pentagon to hexagon, etc)
*Allow save to desktop as jpg?
